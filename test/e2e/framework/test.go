type TestFunc func(t *T, cmd *CiOperatorCommand)

// Run mimics the testing.T.Run function while providing a nice set of concurrency
// guarantees for the processes that we create and manage for test cases. We ensure:
// - the ci-operator process is interrupted (SIGINT) before the test times out, so
//   that it has time to clean up and create artifacts before the test exits
// - any accessory processes that are started will only be exposed to the ci-operator
//   command once they have signalled that they are healthy and ready
// - any accessory processes will have their lifetime bound to the lifetime of the
//   individual test case - they will be killed (SIGKILL) when the test finishes
// - any errors in running an accessory process (other than it being killed by the
//   above mechanism) will be fatal to the test execution and will preempt the other
//   test routines
// This is a generally non-standard use of the testing.T construct; the two largest
// reasons we built this abstraction are that we need to manage a fairly complex and
// fragile set of concurrency and lifetime guarantees for the processes that are
// executed for each test case. We must control the scope in which each test runs, to
// be able to defer() actions that cancel background processes when a test finishes
// execution, as child goroutines are not by default killed when a test finished and
// interaction with the parent testing.T after the test is finished causes a panic.
// Furthermore, we could not simply use the central testing.T for managing control
// flow as it is not allowed to call testing.T.FailNow (via Fatal, etc) in anything
// other than the main testing goroutine. Therefore, when more than one routine needs
// to be able to influence the execution flow (e.g. preempt other routines) we must
// have the central routine watch for incoming errors from delegate routines.
